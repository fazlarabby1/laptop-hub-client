***************************
This is a laptop resale website. This website contains several functionalities. In this website, one can buy and sell products.

***************************
The home page contains a slider, categories option cards, advertise items section, about us section, and a footer.

***************************
To visit the category page or purchase a product or add a product one must become a user of this website.

***************************
For limiting users, access I have use firebase authentication system and also I have used mongodb database to save all the information related to the products and user. Along with the firebase, I have implemented the JWT verification to set different user access depending on their account type.

***************************
Here, I have implemented stripe payment system. And depending on the payment the products status will be changed in the UI.

***************************
In the dashboard route, different user will see different options. For example, admin will see All Users, and All Sellers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
